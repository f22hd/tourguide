            Some of my friends told me that Kampai is one of the best places to eat sushi at.
            I actually felt that it is quite overrated.
            The sushi was fresh and good, however, I did not find anything special either about the taste

            Lately I visited the Khurais Road Riyadh branch,
            place is good but at time too much crowded.

        <item>King Fahd International Stadium</item>
        <item>3.7</item>
        <item>The stadium was built in 1987, being among the first ones to be covered with membrane. More importantly, it instantly became the venue with World’s largest roof. Its surface of 47,000 sqm allowed King Fahd’s stadium to retain the status for almost two decades. The cover is supported by 24 tall pylons and due to dynamic shape resembles a Bedouin tent.</item>

        <item>4.7</item>
        <item>Erection of Jeddah’s new sports centre was announced in a king’s decree in 2009, suggesting the city will again celebrate sport’s role in society. Initial plans envisaged a main stadium for 100,000 people and numerous other buildings spread over 900 hectares. In 2011 the plan was severely downscaled. The surface was reduced to 300 hectares, stadium capacity to 60,000, while secondary amenities limited to an athletic stadium, 2,000-capacity indoor arena, training pitches and a mosque.</item>

        <item>The stadium was built between Jeddah’s university and industrial district in 1970. It’s part of a larger sports complex along with and indoor hall and a natatorium. For almost three decades the only stand equipped in individual seats was the main one that also provides partial cover for fans. The remaining sections forming a “C” shape had terracing until 2009. Along with conversion into all-seater mode its capacity decreased from 23,000 to 20,000.</item>
